Furthermore, there is no combined R/W line, so that signal hat to be split up into /WR and /RD. Here, we just use /OE and /WE which are generated on the CPU board.</p><p><img src=images/io_uart.png alt=io_uart></p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://steckschwein.github.io/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>

We are reflecting on a very special VCFe, as it marked the 10th (or 10 1/2th) birthday of the Steckschwein.

Reconnecting with old friends, making new friends, and celebrating and eating our 12 cycle muffin NOPslide together were all incredibly enjoyable experiences.

Additionally, Marko allowed an exciting sneak peek into his nearly complete Pacman implementation, the first ever on a 6502 that closely replicates the behavior of the original Namco Pacman Arcade.

VCFe 24.0 promises to be a special occasion—not only because we won’t have to wait another year, as it returns to its regular schedule from May 3rd to 4th  2025, but also because it will kick off the lead-up to a milestone. In 2025, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the legendary 6502 processor, with VCFe 24.0 dedicated to this iconic chip—a perfect reason to celebrate again!

See you there!

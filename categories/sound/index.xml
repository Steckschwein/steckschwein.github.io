Starting now, the multi board version of the Steckschwein is made up of 3 Boards: CPU/Memory, IO/UART and V9958-OPL2.</description></item><item><title>New V9958-Board with integrated OPL2</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/new-v9958-board-with-integrated-opl2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/new-v9958-board-with-integrated-opl2/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another hardware upgrade. Since we really want to get our single board Steckschwein done, we are going for higher integration of our multiboard prototype. After integrating the UART to the IO-Board, we integrate the OPL2 sound part onto the V9958 video board, so the current Steckschwein multi board incarnations are reduced to three boards. We did postpone our plan to upgrade sound to OPL3 because Daniel Illgen, which we met at VCFb, convinced us with some awesome OPL2 tunes that OPL2 is still cool.</description></item></channel></rss>

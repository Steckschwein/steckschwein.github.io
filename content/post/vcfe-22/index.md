Looks like the upcoming VCFe 22.0 will be a feast for the 6502-connoisseur: Andre Fachat will show his MicroPET and his 6502 multitasking operating system "GeckOS", Armin Hierstetter will show an authentic Apple I replica, and of course we will be there, too, showing our new banking schema and our emulator.

Save the date(s): 29.4. - 1.5.2023

We really are looking forward to a glorious VCFe, which will also be back at the new old location, the sports hall of the ESV München OST, now at

Hermann-Weinhauser-Straße 7 \
81673 München

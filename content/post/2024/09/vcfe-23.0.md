# VCFe 23.0 - The wait is finally over

The 23th annual European Vintage Computer Festival will take place on 7./8. September 2024!

The special focus of this year's VCFe is _50 years of 8080 and 6800 with a lot of exhibitions and talks around those CPUs.

Also, the Steckschwein will celebrate it's 10 year anniversary (more like 10 1/2 now) with you!

We will be showing all Steckschwein incarnations from its humble and nameless beginnings on a breadboard to the current 512k SBC version!
Also, we will host a talk about the most important milestones and challenges in the last 10 years, and of course we'd like to celebrate!

See you there!

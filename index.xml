The Steckschwein is an 8bit computer that wants to show how much know how is already to be found in a rather simple computer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The name &amp;ldquo;Steckschwein&amp;rdquo; originates to the very early stages of our project, where everything was prototyped on breadboards (german: &amp;ldquo;Steckbrett&amp;rdquo;), and we all know that those things can be real pigs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="images/steckschwein-e1442404875521.jpg" alt="steckschwein"> Early days&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="images/schweinebande.jpg" alt="schweinebande"> First PCB based prototypes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We started off with a very small test circuit, having the 65c02 execute only NOPs, by hard wiring the data lines to $EA. Then,Â  we started to add new components step by step, such as ROM, RAM, IO interface (65c22 VIA), serial interface (UART 16550), until we arrived at the current specifications:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">65c02-CPU&lt;/a> @ &lt;a href="https://example.com/post/chiptuning/">8MHz&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>64k RAM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>32k bankable ROM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Video chip &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TMS9918">TMS9929&lt;/a>, now upgraded to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_V9958">V9958&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sound chip &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM3812">YM3812&lt;/a> (OPL2)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rs232 via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16550_UART">UART 16550&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SPI used as main peripheral bus for:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>sd-card based mass storage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>PS/2-peripheral controller (keyboard, mouse) (ATmega8)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>RTC (&lt;a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS1306.html">Maxim DS1306&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

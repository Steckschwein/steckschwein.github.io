Some research revealed bad connections inside the scope as a possible culprit: <a href=https://hackcorrelation.blogspot.com/2014/01/dso5062b-white-screen-repair-and-hack.html>https://hackcorrelation.blogspot.com/2014/01/dso5062b-white-screen-repair-and-hack.html</a> But in my case, that did not do anything. More research brought me to a couple of messages within the famous Tekway hacking thread on the EEVBlog-Forum: <a href=https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hantek-tekway-dso-hack-get-200mhz-bw-for-free/msg87635/#msg87635>https://www.eevblog.com/forum/testgear/hantek-tekway-dso-hack-get-200mhz-bw-for-free/msg87635/#msg87635</a></p><p>Forum member &ldquo;bbf&rdquo; told me during a conversation, that he had replaced the 3.3V regulator, but did not remember exactly, which regulator he used. With this information, I went to examine the power supply. The 3.3V rail is powered by a KA78R33 regulator, which is rated for a maximum current of 1A. I removed it in order to power the 3.3V rail directly from my bench supply.</p><p><img src=images/photo_2019-02-12_17-33-18.jpg alt> That&rsquo;s a lot of load for the stock 3.3V regulator</p><p>And there we have it. The KA78R33 is under a constant load of almost 1.3A. Also using the bench supply I could play around with the exact voltage and I found out, that the scope is very sensitive about the voltage being correct. A voltage drop down to 3.2V will make the screen go white again. To make things worse, the KA78R33 is completely potted in plastic, which I don&rsquo;t imagine to be the best idea in terms of heat dissipation. So we obviously need a beefier 3.3V regulator. I decided to go for a LM1085 which is rated for 3A, so we have plenty of safety margin. Also, it is almost pin compatible with the KA78R33, if inserted &ldquo;the other way around&rdquo;. Also, the LM1085 does not have GND but Vout on it&rsquo;s housing, so one needs to be careful to not have it touch anything it&rsquo;s not supposed to. So with the new regulator, the scope works like a charm again.</p><p>Originally, the scope was sold as fanless, which was a big selling point for me back then. Inside, there happens to be a place to mount an 50mm 12V fan, also the power supply has a 12V rail just to power a fan. To be on the safe side from now on, I installed a fan. I just replaced the 12V regulator with a 9V one in order to keep fan noise down.</p><p><img src=images/scope_ok_again.jpg alt=scope_ok_again></p></div></article></main></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 Steckschwein.

The key points being:
The PS/2 controller had no way of signalling that there has been a new keystroke, the buffer had to be polled via SPI. The PS/2 controller had no way of talking to the keyboard and had to rely for the keyboard to initialize itself properly. Also, typematic rate and delay could not be set, as couldn&amp;rsquo;t the states of the keyboard LEDs.</description></item></channel></rss>

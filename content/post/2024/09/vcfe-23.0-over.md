We are reflecting on a very special VCFe, as it marked the 10th (or 10 1/2th) birthday of the Steckschwein.

Reconnecting with old friends, making new friends, and celebrating together were all incredibly enjoyable experiences.

Additionally, Marko allowed an exciting sneak peek into his nearly complete Pacman implementation, the first ever on a 6502 that closely replicates the behavior of the original Namco Pacman Arcade.

VCFe 24.0 will also be special – most importantly, we won’t have to wait another year, as it will be back on the regular schedule! But more significantly, 2025 will mark the 50th anniversary of the 6502 processor, and VCFe 24.0 will focus on this legendary chip. A reason to celebrate once more!

See you there!

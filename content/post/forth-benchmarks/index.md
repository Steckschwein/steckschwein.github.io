The main motivation to get Forth up and running on the Steckschwein was to participate at [The Ultimate Benchmark](https://theultimatebenchmark.org/), in order to crush all 8bit competition to dust.

So the plan was to benchmark the Steckschwein live at the VCFe. Unfortunately, Carsten could not be there, so no Forth benchmark competition this year. Recently, Carsten presented his benchmark results using TaliForth2, which led us to run the same benchmarks he did and send the results to Carsten, who was kind enough to include them on his site:

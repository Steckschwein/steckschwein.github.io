Before that, we relied on EPROMs, which required UV erasure before every upgradeâ€”a time-consuming and inconvenient process. Switching to an EEPROM significantly improved our workflow, reducing turnaround time.
However, the 28C256 has a couple of drawbacks:
It cannot be written in-circuit since it requires a 12V programming voltage, which the Steckschwein does not provide.</description></item></channel></rss>

The CPLD now provides all glue logic, such as address decoding, memory mapping, wait state and clock generation. In previous revisions, this part was made up of GALs and a couple of TTL ICs. In order to address 512k, the CPLD provides additional address lines.</description></item><item><title>SPI-Devices</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/spi-devices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/spi-devices/</guid><description>SD-Card as really cheap and lazy mass storage The SD card is the &amp;ldquo;killer application&amp;rdquo;, that sold the idea to us to use SPI as the main peripheral bus. The only additional hardware effort was to level shift the signals from and to the sd-card, as it runs on 3.3V while the Steckschwein uses 5V. To accomplish this, the SPI clock, SPI slave select and MOSI are converted using a 74LS07, with it&amp;rsquo;s open collector outputs pulled up to 3.</description></item></channel></rss>

Check out our homebrew 65c02 8bit goodness including our [brand new video/sound-hardware](http://steckschwein.de/2018/12/07/new-v9958-board-with-integrated-opl2/) at the Make Munich fair. We'll also have BASIC, Forth, a couple of games and candy. Our booth is in Hall 1, Booth Nr. 49, in the "Electronic Innovators"-Area. The did get that right, didn't they?

We have reason to celebrate. It was within the void between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2013 that we started the first breadboard experiments which would later evolve into an actually working 8bit computer with the specifications found [here](/hardware/).
We weren't aiming for anything more specific than "an actually working computer".

The biggest inspiration to get started at all was the [Kiwi](https://www.ist-schlau.de/). Simon's Kiwi is a very impressive machine based on a 68008 CPU, two SIDs and a V9990 VDP. Using an ATmega8 as PS/2 keyboard controller and using a Sony CXA2075M for the video output stage has very much been an inspiration from the Kiwi. 

A significant amount of inspiration for the early stages has been drawn from the [homebuilt section of 6502.org](http://www.6502.org/homebuilt), and there especially from [Chris Ward's 6502 Project](https://www.chrisward.org.uk/6502/spec.shtml). Back then, Chris's project provided a good reference design for us to start from. 

The amount of new stuff to learn to build a computer out of "old" or "retro" components was also massive. We did not have a lot of experience with circuit board design, and had never used KiCad before.
Having been huge C64 nerds back then, we did have some experience in 6502 Assembly programming. We never build large and complex things like a (rudimentary) operating system let alone a FAT32 implementation before.

One of the most amazing things in the last 10 years was to observe the spawning of a whole lot of other new homebrew 8bit computer projects. It seems like homebrew computing has become more of a thing, and maybe we did help that trend not only by being part of it.

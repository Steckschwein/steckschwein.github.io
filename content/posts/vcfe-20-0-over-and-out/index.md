VCFe 20.0 is over, all of a sudden, and we had lots of fun as always.

Many thanks to everyone stopping by at our table, especially to those who voted for us at the poll. We got the fo(u)rth place.

Special thanks to Michael Steil, Andre Fachat und Marco Baye for hanging and hacking with us.

Very special thanks to Andre Fachat for his inpromptu 6502 talk right before our turn. I think we did prepare a real feast for every 6502 afficionado.

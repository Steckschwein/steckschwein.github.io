In order to fill the void in the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2013, we began experimenting with a 65C02 on a breadboard, with it's data bus hard wired to the NOP instruction.
This little experiment would later evolve into an actually working 8bit computer. And that was basically what we were aiming for back then. There was just the dream of building a simple 8bit computer. 
10 years and some significant amount of focus creep later we had build this cool little 8bit machine with the specifications found [here](/hardware/).

Time to take a look back on what we have learned, and on all the cool people we met along the way who contributed in some way, with their time, patience, and sharing a considerable amount of their knowledge with us. 

The biggest inspiration to get started at all was the [Kiwi](https://www.ist-schlau.de/). Simon's Kiwi is a very impressive machine based on a 68008 CPU, two SIDs and a V9990 VDP. Using an ATmega8 as PS/2 keyboard controller and using a Sony CXA2075M for the video output stage has very much been an inspiration from the Kiwi. 

A significant amount of inspiration for the early stages has been drawn from the [homebuilt section of 6502.org](http://www.6502.org/homebuilt), and there especially from [Chris Ward's 6502 Project](https://www.chrisward.org.uk/6502/spec.shtml). Back then, Chris's project provided a good reference design for us to start from. 

We have to thank [Andre Fachat's Pages on 6502.org](http://www.6502.org/users/andre/index.html) for the idea to use a 16550 UART instead of a 6551 ACIA.

Also, [Hans Franke](http://vcfe.org) and [Neil Franklin](http://neil.franklin.ch/) were and are just a neverending source of information and the go-to guys for bouncing ideas around. Hans was the one suggesting using SPI as peripheral bus to us.

The [VCFe (Vintage Computer Festival Europe)](http://vcfe.org), organised by Hans, has become some sort of "home-base" for us. So we have to include everyone we met there.
  

The amount of new stuff to learn to build a computer out of "old" or "retro" components was also massive. We did not have a lot of experience with circuit board design, and had never used KiCad before.
Having been huge C64 nerds back then, we did have some experience in 6502 Assembly programming. We never build large and complex things like a (rudimentary) operating system let alone a FAT32 implementation before.

One of the most amazing things in the last 10 years was to observe the spawning of a whole lot of other new homebrew 8bit computer projects. It seems like homebrew computing has become more of a thing, and maybe we did help that trend not only by being part of it.

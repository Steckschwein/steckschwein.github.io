There seems to be quite some interest in our little project from outside of germany. Thanks to all who are following what we are doing.

To save you the effort of putting our blatherings through Google Translate or even having to learn german, we decided switch to writing our blog articles in english.

The rest of the site will be translated as we go. [The hardware page](http://steckschwein.de/hardware/) has already been translated.

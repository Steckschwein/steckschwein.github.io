One of our design goals is to be able to hook up two Atari/Commodore style joysticks. With only one 8bit IO port left, this is a bit tricky. Our first approach was to wire up the joysticks in a matrix like arrangement, but this suffered from the infamous <a href=https://www.dribin.org/dave/keyboard/one_html/>matrix ghosting problem</a>. Also, port A was completely blocked and could not be used for anything else that way.</p><p>Our next approach included tri state drivers behind every joystick port. That way, in order to read the state of a particular joystick, the respective driver has to be enabled first. It is also possible to disable the drivers altogether, freeing port A up completely, which made it possible to add a freely programmable user port.</p><p><img src=images/io_joyports.png alt=io_joyports></p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://steckschwein.github.io/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>

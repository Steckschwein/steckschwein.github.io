First of all, a closer inspection showed that all SPI devices were attached to the same SPI Slave Select signal. Another schematics copy &amp;amp; paste issue.
Next, the pinout for the SD card socket is totally wrong. The schematics were designed with micro SD in mind, but we changed our mind in the last minute and reverted to a regular SD socket.</description></item><item><title>SBC - troubleshooting</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/sbc-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/sbc-troubleshooting/</guid><description>Our debugging journey at VCFe began right at powering up the board the first time, when something got real hot real fast. Fair enough, and easy to spot. There was a mixup of VCC and GND at U29, a 74HCT244. Embarassing, but not that critical, as U29 is only used to connect the joystick ports to Port A of the VIA. We can live without them for now. The mixup likely happened when I transferred the IO-board schematics from KiCad 6 to 7 while updating the symbols from the current library, which happened to be different than the old ones.</description></item><item><title>It's alive - sort of</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/its-alive-sort-of/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/its-alive-sort-of/</guid><description>Our plan for VCF2 22.0 was to assemble the first Steckschwein SBC right at our booth as some kind of show-cooking event. That only half worked, as this quickly turned into show-debugging instead of show-cooking. It was only just right before the end of VCFe 22.0, just before we had to pack everything up, we managed to get the SBC to talk to us via serial:

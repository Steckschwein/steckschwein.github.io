The ppmview.prg, as the name already tells, is able to load an image in ppm (Portable BitMap) format with a maximum size of 256x212px and displays it on the screen.
The first version of ppmview was released in 2018 and since then we just use the SCREEN 8 (MSX) also known as graphic mode 7 (RGB).</description></item><item><title>V9958 - "The WAIT" - investigation of the CPU/VDP /WAIT interface</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/v9958-the-wait-investigation-of-the-cpu-vdp-wait-interface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/v9958-the-wait-investigation-of-the-cpu-vdp-wait-interface/</guid><description>&amp;hellip; on the way back to munich, we had some time to do a little code review of our gfx library. thinking about the cpu to video chip timings and again read the well known datasheets of the V9938/V9958. suddenly i got an enlightenment and we came to the following conclusion.
as described in the datasheet (V9958-Technical-manual_v1.0.pdf) of the V9958 there are different timings given for different kind of writes. so as far as we understand there are the following timings</description></item></channel></rss>

Before that, we relied on EPROMs, which required UV erasure before every upgradeâ€”a time-consuming and inconvenient process. Switching to an EEPROM significantly improved our workflow, reducing turnaround time.
However, the 28C256 has a couple of drawbacks:
It cannot be written in-circuit since it requires a 12V programming voltage, which the Steckschwein does not provide.</description></item><item><title>V9958 - "The WAIT" - investigation of the CPU/VDP /WAIT interface</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/v9958-the-wait-investigation-of-the-cpu-vdp-wait-interface/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/v9958-the-wait-investigation-of-the-cpu-vdp-wait-interface/</guid><description>&amp;hellip; on the way back to munich, we had some time to do a little code review of our gfx library. thinking about the cpu to video chip timings and again read the well known datasheets of the V9938/V9958. suddenly i got an enlightenment and we came to the following conclusion.
as described in the datasheet (V9958-Technical-manual_v1.0.pdf) of the V9958 there are different timings given for different kind of writes. so as far as we understand there are the following timings</description></item></channel></rss>

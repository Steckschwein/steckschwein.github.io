We are very excited that we will be exhibiting the Steckschwein at the [Vintage Computing Festival Berlin](http://vcfb.de/2018/) . Also, we will be holding a talk about everything Steckschwein on Saturday, the 13.10. at 10:30.

The Vintage Computing Festival Berlin will again be taking place at the "Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin", the German technical museum, which is a very interesting place to go by itself.

This is going to be good.

For reasons mostly related to the pandemic, we did not attend [VCFb](https://www.vcfb.de) since 2019. Finally, this year we managed to be there again, just im time to show our newly assembled rev0.6 (and fully working !!!) SBC boards around, and have tons of fun with other very nice people there (Hello [https://mega65.org/](https://mega65.org/)!). Also, we talked about how the Steckschwein evolved over the last almost 10 years and about our development methodology. As always at VCFb, the talk was streamed and the video is available at [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de/v/vcfb2023_-_191_-_de_-_202310151100_-_das_steckschwein_-_thomas_woinke_-_marko_lauke). Our slides from our talk can be downloaded in PDF format [here](images/VCFb23.pdf) and [here](images/PraÌˆse_22.0_Emu.pdf).

Thanks to everyone who attended or visited us at our booth. We will return next year!

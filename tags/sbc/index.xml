Fair enough, and easy to spot. There was a mixup of VCC and GND at U29, a 74HCT244. Embarassing, but not that critical, as U29 is only used to connect the joystick ports to Port A of the VIA. We can live without them for now. The mixup likely happened when I transferred the IO-board schematics from KiCad 6 to 7 while updating the symbols from the current library, which happened to be different than the old ones.</description></item><item><title>It's alive - sort of</title><link>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/its-alive-sort-of/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.steckschwein.de/post/its-alive-sort-of/</guid><description>Our plan for VCF2 22.0 was to assemble the first Steckschwein SBC right at our booth as some kind of show-cooking event. That only half worked, as this quickly turned into show-debugging instead of show-cooking. It was only just right before the end of VCFe 22.0, just before we had to pack everything up, we managed to get the SBC to talk to us via serial:
